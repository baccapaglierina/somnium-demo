INPUT:

the snap rotation can be done through left/right with the right analog;
hand trigger in both hands for grabbing and releasing objects;
left index trigger for snapping 360 panoramic pictures;
A button for UI button interaction;
-
EXPERIENCES:
360 Panoramic Picture:
Moving to the Panorama area - you can even teleport on the spot - and grab the camera stick with any hand trigger.
You can move it to any position and pose for a panoramic picture. The camera is mirrored so it looks a bit funny rn but it should be fixed with 1 line of code.
Snap the picture with the left index trigger, now a new sphere with a 360 picture inside appeared on the column left to the Panorama area - go and grab it!
You can interact with it and go inside to see the moment you've impressed forever in the /assets folder!
And if you don't like how it came out...throw it away!
-
Interactable Map:
Moving to the Minimap area and grab it with the left hand - so you can use the pointer coming out from the right hand.
While keeping the minimap grabbed, you can point and interact with the buttons on the minimap with the A button of the right controller.
Move it around with the buttons, adjust the zoom if need, and search a friend.
When the minimap camera spot a friend (red spot) a new arrow should appear in front of you. Release the minimap now and move around the enviroment.
The arrow should disappear once you reach your friend. You can make appear another arrow by going back to the minimap area and interact again.
